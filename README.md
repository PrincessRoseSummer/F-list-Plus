# F-list+

F-list+ is a web extension to help make your life on F-list just a little bit smoother.

## Description

F-list+ can be installed on Chromium browsers and Firefox. It's completely free to use and you will never need to pay to use any of the features of F-list+.

Right now, F-list+ consists of three different features.
- Automate the uploading of images to your character gallery.
- Sort your searchable kinks into four different dropdowns for each category (Favorites, Yes, Maybe, No)
- Import and Export your custom kinks as a CSV sheet. (Doesn't support excel sheets, make sure it's a CSV sheet)

### Image Uploading
Here, the only difference is being able to select multiple images at once instead of uploading images one by one. The UI has slight changes but it's quite similar to what you see normally.

Select multiple images then press the upload images button. It'll take some time to upload all the images so be patient. But to prevent double uploads, the button will be disabled for a few seconds.

As the images upload, it'll check if the image is compatible or not. If the image doesn't follow F-list's guidelines, it'll start compiling a list below that you can use to know which images require adjusting. It'll highlight in red what is invalid. As a reminder, the image needs to be at most 2000x2000 and 2MB.

### Sorting Searchable Kinks
This tool works in the subfetish editor. None of the original user interface has changed, but some new UI has been added below. Four text boxes, space to enter the names of your custom kinks that you wish to turn into dropdowns, and a button below to organise the kinks.

You can leave some boxes blank, and it simply won't organise the kinks for that category. For example, maybe you don't want a dropdown for your maybe column? Then you can simply leave that box blank. If you mispell a custom kink, it'll also not work so please do check your spelling.

### Import and Export Custom Kinks
Custom kinks work as usual, but now you can import and export spreadsheets with your kinks. This allows you to edit your kinks quicker, easier and share your custom kinks with others easily. **For now, the only files that are compatible are .CSV files.** These are comma separated values, which are essentially a more basic version of Excel.

I'd recommend to export a sheet first before working on them, so you don't have to worry abuot trying to make sure your spreadsheet is compatible. Making Excel work with F-list seemed to be a possible headache so I'm sticking with CSV files for now.

The sheet has three columns: a name, description and a category.

# Known Issues
- On Firefox, sometimes you might have to click on the extension in the toolbar to activate it.
- The csv file has an extra empty row that's categorised as favourites sometimes.
- Exporting can sometimes cause issues with double speech marks.
- GIFs aren't whitelisted as an uploadable option.
